# Versioning

### Summary

In general, the semantic versioning schema should be followed.

> Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
> - MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
> - MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
> - PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

### Kernel version

* Increase MAJOR version when introducing major changes: e.g., new virtual machine, significant consensus changes and new p2p protocol
* Increase MINOR version when making scheduled/incremental changes: e.g., new feature and enhancements
* Increase PATCH version for bugfixes only

### Api Version

* Increase MAJOR version when the API becomes incompatible
* Increase MINOR version when adding new endpoints
* Reserved
