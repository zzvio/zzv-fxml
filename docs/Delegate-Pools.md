# Delegate Pools

A pool is a [validator](./Delegates-and-Validators.md) that shares a portion of forged earnings with voters.

Each pool has its own fees and payout structure, but most pay daily.  Not all validators are pools, many are 
privately owned, or private pools by invite only.  The pool stats site below documents currently known public pools.
