# Semux Virtual Machine

The Semux VM allows users to create programmatic logic on the blockchain.

Semux VM will be launched with the 1.5.0 release.  It is currently available in the [Testnet](./Testnet.md)

It utilizes the well known ethereum VM format/language for contracts, so it is compatible with Solidity, and soon will
be support web3js.

It uses gas and gas prices in the same mechanism as used for ethereum.

It supports all of the Byzantium ethereum constructs, as well as two new calls specific to Semux, Vote and Unvote.

Please be patient as we update these documents.  More to come.
