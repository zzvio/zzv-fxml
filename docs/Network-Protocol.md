# Network Protocol

Clients send messages to peers in order to interact with the blockchain.  These can be
divided into general peer messages, and consensus methods used by validators for forging blocks.

Messages are written using the Semux [Message Encoding](./Message-Encoding.md) format.

Messages send the code byte first, then the parameters in order


## Standard Message Objects

### Peer

Message:
- ip (string)
- port (int)
- networkVersion (short)
- clientId (string)
- peerId (string)
- latestBlockNumber (long) 
- capabilities size (int)
- capabilities[] (string[])

## Peer Messages

### Hello

Code: 0x01

Initiate a connection with a peer.  No messages will be accepted until after this handshake is done.

Message:

Respond to a Ping message.

Message:
- timestamp (long)

### Disconnect

Code: 0x00

Inform a peer of disconnection.  Reasons can include too many peers, invalid handshake, or other.

Message:
- reason (byte)

### Get Nodes

Code: 0x05

Request peers of the peer.

Message:
None.

### Nodes Response

Code: 0x06

Send a list of current peers.

Message:
- size (int) (number of nodes)
- ip (string)
- port (int)

### Transaction

Code: 0x07

Propagate a transaction from mempool.

Message:
- hash (byte[])
- networkId (byte)
- type (byte)
- to (byte[])
- amount (long)
- fee (long)
- nonce (long)
- timestamp (long)
- data (byte[])
- signature (byte[])

for CALL and CREATE types
- gas (long)
- gasPrice (long)


### Get Block Header

Code: 0x30

Request a block header.

Message:
- number (long)

### Block Header Response

Code: 0x31

Send a block header.

Message:
- hash (byte[])
- number (long)
- coinbase (byte[])
- previous hash (byte[])
- timestamp (long)
- transaction root (byte[])
- result root (byte[])
- state root (byte[])
- data (byte[])

## BFT Messages

### New View

Code: 0x41

### Proposal

Code: 0x42
